🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Console Game
📌 About the Project
This is a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed in C++.
You choose the number of rounds and play against the computer, which makes random choices. After each round, the program announces whether you won, lost, or tied. At the end of the game, you can choose to play again for unlimited fun.

✨ Features
🎯 Customizable Rounds – Choose how many times you want to play.

🤖 Computer AI – The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

🏆 Round Results – Displays win, loss, or tie after each turn.

🔁 Replay Option – Option to play again without restarting the program.

🖥 Lightweight Console App – Runs in any terminal without additional dependencies.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++

Concepts:

Random number generation (rand() function)

Conditional statements (if-else, switch)

Loops (for, while)

User input validation

Basic game logic implementation

📌 Why This Project Matters
This small project is a fun way to practice:

Structuring a simple C++ program

Using loops and conditionals

Implementing basic game logic

Working with randomness in programming
